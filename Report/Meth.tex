\section{Methodologies}
\label{Metho}

This Section presents the methodologies used to accomplish the project goals. Further details for the Sentiment Analysis techniques can be found in \cite{Aggarwal}.

\subsection{Data collection and preprocessing}

First of all, the datasets were loaded from csv format into a Python Notebook. Since articles and comments from different months were stored in different files, I had to merge them into two Pandas DataFrames. After that, all the features considered unnecessary for the project were removed. 
The following step is to preprocess the comment bodies in order to prepare them for sentiment analysis. The preprocessing tasks included punctuation removal, lowering of text, stop-word removal and stemming. The latter two were performed using classes from the NLTK package \cite{NLTK}. In particular, stemming was performed via a Porter Stemmer.

\subsection{Sentiment Calculation}
Once the comments were ready to be processed, a lexicon-based method was used to calculate polarity for each word in the comments.

This repository contains the project for the course _Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis_ held by Professor Alfio Ferrara at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano in 2021.

The dataset was not uploaded to the repository due to its large size, but it is downloadable [here][1].

### Usage

The project consists of a simple Jupyter Notebook with all the calculations. A report is also available in PDF format, together with its ```.tex``` source file.
If you downloaded the dataset from Kaggle, please store all your files in a directory named "dataset" in the same directory of the notebook. Alternatively, change the path in the data loading cell.

Note that the preprocessing takes quite a long time (2-3 hours), because of the large size of the input dataset. If you would like to access the already preprocessed files, contact and I will send them to you. Unfortunately, I cannot upload them for size reasons.

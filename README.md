This repository contains the project for the course _Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis_ held by Professor [Alfio Ferrara][4] at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano in 2021.

The dataset was not uploaded to the repository due to its large size, but it is downloadable [here][1].

### Usage

The project consists of a simple Jupyter Notebook with all the calculations. A report is also available in PDF format, together with its ```.tex``` source file.
If you downloaded the dataset from Kaggle, please store all your files in a directory named "dataset" in the same directory of the notebook. Alternatively, change the path in the data loading cell.

Note that the preprocessing takes quite a long time (2-3 hours), because of the large size of the input dataset. If you would like to access the already preprocessed files, contact me [here][3] and I will send them to you. Unfortunately, I cannot upload them for size reasons.
